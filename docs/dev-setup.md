# Development Setup Guide

## Version Control Strategy

### Branching Model

- `main`: Production releases (protected branch)
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches

### Workflow Rules

1. All changes through pull requests
2. Require 2 approvals for main merges
3. Squash merge for feature branches
4. Semantic commit messages
5. CI/CD must pass before merging
