# Accessibility Strategy for AestheticPalettes

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Accessibility Strategy for the AestheticPalettes application, as per task T029. The primary goal is to achieve **WCAG 2.1 Level AAA compliance** where feasible, and at a minimum, strong Level AA compliance across all features. Accessibility is a critical non-functional requirement (NFR2.x) and a core project principle.

This strategy will guide design, development, and testing to ensure the application is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments.

## 2. Guiding Principles & Standards

- **WCAG 2.1:** Adherence to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1, targeting Level AAA.
- **POUR Principles:** Design and development will follow the four main principles of accessibility:
  - **Perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
  - **Operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable.
  - **Understandable:** Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
  - **Robust:** Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety
    of user agents, including assistive technologies.
- **Inclusive Design:** Design for a diverse range of users from the outset.
- **Usability for All:** Ensure that features are not only technically accessible but also usable and intuitive for people with disabilities.
- **Zero-Cost Tools:** Utilize free and open-source tools for accessibility testing and validation.

## 3. Key Areas of Focus & Implementation Strategies

### 3.1. Semantic HTML

- **Strategy:** Use HTML5 elements according to their semantic meaning (e.g., `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<button>`, proper heading levels `<h1>` - `<h6>`).
- **Tools:** Linters (ESLint with accessibility plugins), browser developer tools.
- **Benefit:** Provides inherent accessibility for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

### 3.2. Keyboard Accessibility (NFR2.2)

- **Strategy:**
  - All interactive elements (links, buttons, form controls, custom components) must be focusable and operable via keyboard.
  - Logical focus order must be maintained.
  - Visible focus indicators must be clear and have sufficient contrast (WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible - AA, enhanced for AAA).
  - Avoid keyboard traps (WCAG 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap - A).
  - Implement standard keyboard interactions for custom widgets (e.g., ARIA design patterns).
- **Tools:** Manual keyboard testing (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys), Headless UI (provides accessible components out-of-the-box).
- **Benefit:** Essential for users with motor impairments and screen reader users.

### 3.3. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) (NFR2.3)

- **Strategy:**
  - Use ARIA attributes judiciously to enhance the accessibility of custom components and dynamic content where semantic HTML is insufficient.
  - Follow ARIA design patterns for common widgets (modals, tabs, carousels, etc.).
  - Ensure ARIA states and properties are updated dynamically (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, `aria-hidden`).
  - Avoid redundant ARIA (e.g., `role="button"` on a `<button>` element).
- **Tools:** ARIA Authoring Practices Guide, Headless UI, accessibility testing tools.
- **Benefit:** Provides necessary information to assistive technologies for complex UI elements.

### 3.4. Color Contrast & Information Conveyed by Color (NFR2.1, NFR2.4)

- **Strategy:**
  - **Text Contrast (WCAG 1.4.3 - AA, 1.4.6 - AAA):**
    - Normal text: Minimum 4.5:1 (AA), strive for 7:1 (AAA).
    - Large text (18pt or 14pt bold): Minimum 3:1 (AA), strive for 4.5:1 (AAA).
  - **Non-text Contrast (WCAG 1.4.11 - AA):** UI components and graphical objects require a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s).
  - **Information Not Solely by Color (WCAG 1.4.1 - A):** Ensure information conveyed by color is also available through text, icons, or other visual cues (e.g., an error message icon alongside red text).
- **Tools:** WebAIM Contrast Checker, Lighthouse, axe DevTools, browser developer tools (color pickers with contrast ratio display).
- **Benefit:** Crucial for users with low vision and color blindness.

### 3.5. Text Alternatives for Non-Text Content (NFR2.5)

- **Strategy:**
  - Provide appropriate `alt` text for all informative images (`<img>`, `<svg>`).
  - Use empty `alt=""` for decorative images.
  - Provide text alternatives for icons (e.g., `aria-label`, visually hidden text).
  - Transcripts and captions for audio/video content (if any).
- **Tools:** Manual review, accessibility checkers.
- **Benefit:** Essential for screen reader users and users with images disabled.

### 3.6. Responsive Design & Zoom (NFR2.6)

- **Strategy:**
  - Ensure the application is responsive across various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
  - Content should reflow without loss of information or functionality when zoomed up to 400% (WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow - AA).
  - Avoid horizontal scrolling for content at standard viewport widths.
- **Tools:** Browser developer tools (responsive mode), manual testing by resizing browser/zooming.
- **Benefit:** Supports users with low vision who rely on zoom, and users on various devices.

### 3.7. Forms & Input Assistance (NFR2.7)

- **Strategy:**
  - Properly associate labels with form controls (`<label for="id">`).
  - Use `fieldset` and `legend` for grouping related controls.
  - Provide clear instructions and error messages.
  - Identify input errors and suggest corrections (WCAG 3.3.1 Error Identification - A, 3.3.3 Error Suggestion - AA).
  - Ensure error messages are programmatically associated with the relevant input field (e.g., using `aria-describedby`).
- **Tools:** Manual testing, accessibility checkers.
- **Benefit:** Improves usability for all users, especially those with cognitive disabilities or using assistive technologies.

### 3.8. Understandable Content & Navigation (NFR2.8)

- **Strategy:**
  - Use clear and concise language.
  - Ensure consistent navigation across the site.
  - Provide multiple ways to find content (e.g., navigation menu, search, sitemap if applicable) (WCAG 2.4.5 Multiple Ways - AA).
  - Page titles should be descriptive and unique (WCAG 2.4.2 Page Titled - A).
  - Headings should be used to structure content logically (WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and Labels - AA).
- **Tools:** Content review, information architecture planning.
- **Benefit:** Supports users with cognitive disabilities, screen reader users, and improves overall usability.

### 3.9. Timeouts (WCAG 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable - A)

- **Strategy:** If any time limits are set by the content, provide users with options to turn off, adjust, or extend the time limit, unless the time limit is essential.
- **Benefit:** Supports users who require more time to complete tasks.

### 3.10. Animations and Motion (WCAG 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide - A; 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions - AAA)

- **Strategy:**
  - Provide mechanisms to pause, stop, or hide any moving, blinking, or scrolling information that starts automatically, lasts more than five seconds, and is presented in parallel with other content.
  - For AAA, motion animation triggered by interaction can be disabled, unless the animation is essential to the functionality or the information being conveyed.
  - Avoid content that flashes more than three times per second (WCAG 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold - A).
- **Tools:** `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
- **Benefit:** Prevents issues for users with vestibular disorders, epilepsy, and attention difficulties.

## 4. Development Process Integration

- **Design Phase:** Accessibility considerations (color contrast, interactive element design, ARIA patterns for custom components) will be part of the UI/UX design process (T028).
- **Component Development:** Use accessible component libraries (e.g., Headless UI) as a base. Custom components will be built with accessibility in mind from the start.
- **Code Reviews:** Accessibility checks will be part of the code review process.
- **Automated Testing:** Integrate accessibility linters (e.g., `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` for React) and automated testing tools (e.g., axe-core via Jest/Cypress) into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Manual Testing:** Regular manual testing using keyboards, screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver), and browser accessibility tools.

## 5. Testing & Validation Tools

- **Browser Developer Tools:** Built-in accessibility inspectors (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- **axe DevTools:** Browser extension for automated accessibility testing.
- **Lighthouse:** Auditing tool in Chrome DevTools, includes accessibility checks.
- **WebAIM Contrast Checker:** For verifying color contrast ratios.
- **NVDA (Windows) / VoiceOver (macOS):** Screen readers for manual testing.
- **Keyboard-only navigation:** Manual testing.
- **eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y / eslint-plugin-svelte3-accessibility:** Static analysis for common issues.

## 6. Documentation & Training

- This Accessibility Strategy document will be maintained and updated.
- Developers will be encouraged to familiarize themselves with WCAG guidelines and ARIA best practices.

## 7. Continuous Improvement

- Accessibility is an ongoing effort. Feedback from users (if possible) and regular audits will inform improvements.
- Stay updated with new accessibility guidelines and best practices.

By implementing this strategy, AestheticPalettes aims to be a highly accessible application, providing an inclusive experience for all users, in line with its core project goals and NFRs.
