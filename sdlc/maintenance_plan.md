# Maintenance Plan: AestheticPalettes

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the maintenance plan for the AestheticPalettes application, as per task T030. The plan details the activities required to ensure the application remains functional, secure, up-to-date, and continues to meet user needs post-deployment, all while adhering to the zero-cost infrastructure constraint.

## 2. Maintenance Goals

- **Ensure Application Stability & Availability:** Keep the application running smoothly with minimal downtime.
- **Preserve Security:** Address vulnerabilities and keep the application secure.
- **Manage Zero-Cost Constraints:** Continuously monitor resource usage to stay within free-tier limits.
- **Address User Feedback & Bugs:** Provide a mechanism for users to report issues and incorporate fixes.
- **Keep Technology Current:** Regularly update dependencies and frameworks.
- **Support User Growth:** Ensure the application can handle a growing user base within the defined architectural limits.

## 3. Maintenance Activities

### 3.1. Monitoring

- **Performance Monitoring:**
  - Utilize built-in analytics from Vercel/Netlify to monitor response times, function execution, and overall site speed.
  - Track client-side performance metrics (e.g., Lighthouse scores periodically).
- **Uptime Monitoring:**
  - Leverage Vercel/Netlify platform status pages.
  - Consider a free external uptime monitoring service (e.g., UptimeRobot free tier) for alerts.
- **Resource Usage Monitoring (Critical for Zero-Cost):**
  - Regularly check dashboards on Vercel/Netlify, Supabase, and any other third-party services for:
    - Bandwidth usage.
    - Serverless function invocations and execution duration.
    - Database storage, operations, and connections.
    - API call limits for any integrated services (e.g., email, AI).
  - Set up billing alerts on all platforms (even if the target is $0, to catch accidental overages).
- **Error Logging & Reporting:**
  - Monitor serverless function logs via Vercel/Netlify.
  - Implement client-side error tracking if a free-tier solution is available (e.g., Sentry's limited free tier, or basic logging to a serverless function).

### 3.2. User Feedback and Bug Fixing

- **Feedback Channels:**
  - Provide a clear way for users to report bugs or suggest features (e.g., a contact email, a GitHub Issues page if the project is public, or a simple feedback form).
- **Bug Tracking:**
  - Use GitHub Issues to log, prioritize, and track bugs.
- **Resolution Process:**
  - Prioritize critical bugs affecting core functionality or security.
  - Follow the standard development workflow (branch, fix, test, PR, merge, deploy) for bug fixes.

### 3.3. Updates and Upgrades

- **Dependency Management:**
  - Regularly review and update frontend and backend dependencies (npm packages) using tools like `npm outdated` and `npm audit`.
  - Test thoroughly after updates, especially major version changes.
- **Security Patches:**
  - Promptly apply security patches for all software components, including OS (if any part was self-managed, though not planned), frameworks, and libraries.
- **Platform Updates:**
  - Stay informed about updates or changes to Vercel/Netlify, Supabase, and other services, especially regarding their free tiers.
- **SvelteKit/Framework Updates:** Plan for periodic updates to the core SvelteKit framework.

### 3.4. Content and SEO Management (Ongoing)

- **SEO Monitoring:** Track basic SEO performance using free tools (e.g., Google Search Console).
- **Content Updates:** If the application includes blog posts or guides, plan for periodic reviews and updates.

### 3.5. Database Maintenance (Supabase)

- **Performance:** Monitor query performance and optimize as needed.
- **Backups:** Rely on Supabase's automated backup procedures for the free tier. Understand their frequency and retention.
  - Consider occasional manual data exports for critical data if feasible and simple to implement.
- **Data Integrity:** Periodically check for data inconsistencies if any complex data operations are performed.

### 3.6. Security Maintenance

- **Periodic Security Audits (Informal):**
  - Review application for common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
  - Check Supabase security rules and RLS policies.
  - Ensure API endpoints have proper authorization.
- **Monitor for Breaches:** Stay informed about security advisories for used technologies.

### 3.7. Documentation Maintenance

- Keep all SDLC documents, including this maintenance plan, up-to-date.
- Update user documentation and technical documentation as the application evolves.

## 4. Maintainability Practices (Ensuring Ease of Maintenance)

These practices, established during development, are crucial for effective long-term maintenance:

- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Well-documented code, architecture, APIs, and processes.
- **Modular Code:** A well-structured codebase with clear separation of concerns makes it easier to isolate and fix issues or add features.
- **Consistent Coding Standards:** Adherence to ESLint, Prettier, and other defined standards improves readability and reduces errors.
- **Version Control (Git/GitHub):** All code and documentation changes are tracked, enabling easy rollbacks and collaboration.
- **Automated Testing:** A robust suite of unit, integration, and potentially E2E tests helps catch regressions during maintenance updates.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated build, test, and deployment processes streamline the release of updates and fixes.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** (As detailed in section 3.1) Provides insights into application health and issues.
- **Regular Refactoring:** Periodically review and refactor code to improve clarity, performance, and maintainability, and to remove technical debt.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** (Primarily relevant if team size grows) Ensure project knowledge is not siloed.

## 5. Resource Allocation

- **Primary Responsibility:** Project Lead (Ahmed Rehan).
- **Time Allocation:** Dedicate a small, regular amount of time for proactive maintenance tasks (e.g., checking logs, updating dependencies). Reactive maintenance (bug fixing) will be prioritized as needed.

## 6. Cost Management

- All maintenance activities must be performed within the constraints of the free-tier services.
- If resource usage approaches free-tier limits, optimization strategies will be prioritized over considering paid upgrades.

## 7. Plan Review

This maintenance plan will be reviewed and updated annually, or as significant changes occur in the application, its underlying technologies, or the terms of service of its hosted platforms.

By following this plan, AestheticPalettes aims to remain a reliable, secure, and useful tool for its users over the long term without incurring operational costs.
