# Serverless Functions Implementation Plan (Task T050)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the implementation plan for setting up backend serverless functions for the AestheticPalettes application, as per task T050. After thorough research and analysis of various serverless function platforms, we have selected **Vercel Functions** as our implementation choice. This document details the rationale, setup process, and integration with our existing architecture.

## 2. Platform Selection Rationale

After evaluating Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions, and Cloudflare Workers against our project requirements, Vercel Functions emerged as the optimal choice for the following reasons:

### 2.1 Free Tier Advantages

- **Generous Resource Allocation**: Vercel offers 100GB-hours of serverless execution on the free tier, which is more flexible than Netlify's 125k invocations limit for our GraphQL API needs.
- **Bandwidth**: 100GB bandwidth per month (free tier), sufficient for development and initial production.
- **Build Minutes**: 6,000 build minutes per month, significantly more than Netlify's 300 minutes.

### 2.2 Technical Advantages

- **Language Support**: Supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Python, and Ruby, providing flexibility for future development.
- **GraphQL Support**: Excellent support for GraphQL APIs with easy integration of Apollo Server.
- **Express-like Syntax**: Offers an intuitive Express.js-like `(req, res) => {...}` format for JavaScript functions.
- **Edge Functions**: Better performance with edge functions for global distribution, reducing latency for users worldwide.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Superior support for SSR, which may be beneficial for future development phases.

### 2.3 Integration Capabilities

- **Supabase Integration**: Official Vercel integration with Supabase, providing automatic environment variable configuration.
- **Environment Variables**: Automatic management of Supabase environment variables, including auth redirect URIs for deployments.
- **Monorepo Support**: Better support for monorepo structures if needed in the future.

## 3. Implementation Steps

### 3.1 Initial Setup

1. **Create Vercel Account**: Sign up for a Vercel account using GitHub integration for seamless deployment.
2. **Project Configuration**: Set up a new project in Vercel connected to our GitHub repository.
3. **Environment Setup**: Configure the necessary environment variables for Supabase integration.

### 3.2 Serverless Function Structure

```
src/
  api/           # Serverless functions directory
    graphql.js   # Main GraphQL API endpoint
    auth/        # Authentication-related functions
      login.js
      register.js
      reset-password.js
    palettes/    # Palette management functions
      save.js
      collections.js
      search.js
```

### 3.3 GraphQL API Implementation

1. **Apollo Server Setup**: Implement Apollo Server Lambda for our GraphQL endpoint.

```javascript
// src/api/graphql.js
import { ApolloServer } from "apollo-server-micro";
import { typeDefs } from "../../lib/graphql/schema";
import { resolvers } from "../../lib/graphql/resolvers";
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
);

const apolloServer = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  context: ({ req }) => {
    return { supabase, req };
  },
});

const startServer = apolloServer.start();

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  await startServer;
  await apolloServer.createHandler({
    path: "/api/graphql",
  })(req, res);
}

export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false,
  },
};
```

2. **Schema Definition**: Create GraphQL schema for palettes, users, and other entities.
3. **Resolver Implementation**: Implement resolvers that interact with Supabase.

### 3.4 Authentication Functions

Implement serverless functions for authentication using Supabase Auth:

- User registration with email verification
- Login with email and social providers
- Password reset functionality
- Session management

### 3.5 Palette Management Functions

Implement serverless functions for palette operations:

- Save palettes to user accounts
- Organize palettes into collections
- Add tags to palettes
- Search palettes by name, tag, or color

## 4. Security Implementation

### 4.1 Basic Security Measures

- HTTPS enforcement
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure password storage via Supabase Auth

### 4.2 Advanced Security

- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on critical endpoints
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Local Development

- Use Vercel CLI for local development and testing
- Implement unit tests with Jest for serverless functions
- Mock Supabase dependencies for isolated testing

### 5.2 Integration Testing

- Test GraphQL API endpoints with actual Supabase integration
- Verify authentication flows end-to-end
- Test performance and response times

## 6. Deployment Process

### 6.1 CI/CD Integration

- Configure GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- Set up automatic deployment to Vercel on push to main branch
- Implement preview deployments for pull requests

### 6.2 Environment Management

- Configure development, staging, and production environments
- Manage environment-specific variables securely

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

- Set up logging for serverless functions
- Monitor function execution and performance
- Implement error tracking and alerting

## 8. Future Scaling Considerations

- Transition to Vercel Pro plan if usage exceeds free tier limits
- Optimize function execution to minimize resource usage
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## 9. Conclusion

Vercel Functions provides the optimal platform for implementing our serverless backend requirements while adhering to the zero-cost infrastructure constraint. The implementation plan outlined above will enable us to build a scalable, secure, and performant GraphQL API for the AestheticPalettes application.
