# Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan: AestheticPalettes

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the potential risks associated with the AestheticPalettes project and the proposed mitigation strategies. This aligns with task T022 in the project roadmap. A proactive approach to risk management is crucial for project success, especially given the zero-cost infrastructure constraint.

## 2. Risk Identification Methodology

Risks have been identified by reviewing project goals, requirements (functional and non-functional), technology choices, and external dependencies. The categories considered include:

- **Technical Risks:** Related to technology, architecture, development process, and performance.
- **Project Management Risks:** Related to planning, execution, scope, timeline, and resources.
- **External Risks:** Related to third-party services, open-source libraries, and market changes.
- **Financial Risks:** Primarily related to maintaining the zero-cost infrastructure.

## 3. Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

1. **Free Tier Limitations**

   - Mitigation: Implement usage monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
   - Fallback: Enable Vercel Pro tier trial during traffic spikes

2. **Color Algorithm Complexity**

## 4. Risk Register

(A more detailed risk register can be maintained, potentially in a spreadsheet, tracking status, review dates, etc. For this document, the tables above serve as the primary register.)

## 5. Risk Monitoring and Review

- Risks will be reviewed at the start of each project phase.
- The project lead is responsible for monitoring risks.
- Any new significant risks identified will be added to this document.
- Mitigation strategies will be adjusted as needed based on project progress and changing circumstances.

## 6. Conclusion

While the AestheticPalettes project aims for a zero-cost infrastructure, it is not without risks. By identifying these risks early and planning mitigation strategies, the project increases its likelihood of success in delivering a valuable and sustainable product.
