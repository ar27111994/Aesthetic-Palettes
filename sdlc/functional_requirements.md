# Functional Requirements: AestheticPalettes

## 1. Introduction

This document details the functional requirements for the AestheticPalettes application, as per task T022. These requirements define the specific behaviors, features, and functions the system must perform to meet user needs and project objectives, aiming for feature parity with Coolors.co and introducing unique enhancements.
