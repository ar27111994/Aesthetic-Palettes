# Technology Stack Selection for AestheticPalettes

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the selected technology stack for the AestheticPalettes project, as per task T023. The choices are guided by the project's requirements, particularly the zero-cost infrastructure constraint (NFR8), scalability, maintainability, and the feature set of Coolors.co.

## 2. Guiding Principles for Technology Selection

- **Zero-Cost:** All selected technologies must have a robust free tier that can support the application's initial development, launch, and a reasonable amount of traffic and data.
- **Open Source:** Preference for well-maintained open-source software to ensure flexibility and community support.
- **Scalability:** Technologies should allow for scaling if the application grows beyond the free tier capabilities, even if that involves future costs.
- **Developer Experience:** Tools and frameworks that offer good developer experience, productivity, and have strong communities.
- **Performance:** Stack choices should enable the creation of a fast and responsive user experience.
- **Ecosystem Compatibility:** Technologies should integrate well with each other.

## 3. Selected Technology Stack

### 3.1. Frontend

- **Framework:** Next.js (includes React with TypeScript)
  - _Rationale:_ Next.js is a comprehensive React framework offering server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and a great developer experience. It simplifies building full-stack React applications and includes TypeScript support out-of-the-box. It handles its own build process, optimizing for performance and developer efficiency.
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
  - _Rationale:_ Official, opinionated, and powerful way to write Redux logic. Simplifies store setup and reduces boilerplate.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
  - _Rationale:_ Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. Highly customizable and helps maintain consistency. Ensures only necessary CSS is bundled.
- **UI Component Library (Base):** Headless UI
  - _Rationale:_ Provides unstyled, fully accessible UI components that work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS. Allows for complete control over styling while ensuring accessibility best practices.
- **Color Processing Libraries:** `chroma.js` and/or `colord`
  - _Rationale:_ Lightweight, powerful libraries for color conversions, analysis, and manipulation, crucial for a color palette application.

### 3.2. Backend

- **Architecture:** Serverless Functions
  - _Rationale:_ Aligns perfectly with the zero-cost model. Pay-per-use (often with generous free tiers), scales automatically, reduces operational overhead.
- **Platform:** Vercel Functions
  - _Rationale:_ Vercel Functions integrate seamlessly with Next.js applications hosted on Vercel, providing an easy way to deploy serverless APIs. This aligns with the zero-cost model and simplifies the deployment pipeline.

### 3.3. Database

- **Service:** Supabase (using its underlying PostgreSQL database)
  - _Rationale:_ Open-source Firebase alternative. Provides a generous free tier including a PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and auto-generated APIs. Simplifies backend development significantly.

### 3.4. Authentication

- **Service:** Supabase Auth
  - _Rationale:_ Integrated with the Supabase ecosystem. Provides email/password, social logins (Google, GitHub, etc.), and JWT-based session management. Simplifies user management and aligns with the zero-cost goal by using the same provider as the database.

### 3.5. API Layer

- **Paradigm:** GraphQL
  - _Rationale:_ Allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. Provides a strongly-typed schema. Can be implemented on top of serverless functions (e.g., using Apollo Server or a similar library compatible with the chosen serverless platform).
  - Supabase provides auto-generated REST and GraphQL (via community extension or its own beta) APIs, which can be leveraged or extended with custom serverless functions.

### 3.6. Hosting & Deployment

- **Frontend & Static Assets:** Vercel
  - _Rationale:_ Vercel offers an excellent free tier for hosting Next.js applications, with features like global CDN, CI/CD integration, custom domains, and HTTPS. It's the natural choice when using Next.js and Vercel Functions.
- **Serverless Functions:** Vercel Functions (as mentioned in Backend).
- **Database & Auth:** Supabase Cloud.

## 4. Justification against Zero-Cost Constraint (NFR8)

- **React, Vite, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI:** These are all client-side libraries/tools and do not incur hosting costs themselves.
- **Vercel/Netlify:** Provide generous free tiers for hosting static frontends and serverless functions, sufficient for initial launch and moderate traffic.
- **Supabase:** Offers a free tier that includes PostgreSQL database, authentication, and storage, suitable for the project's initial scale.
- **Cloudflare Workers (if chosen):** Also has a generous free tier for serverless compute.

By carefully managing resource usage (e.g., optimizing database queries, efficient function execution, client-side rendering where possible), the application can operate within these free tiers.

## 5. Future Considerations & Scalability

While the primary goal is zero-cost, the chosen technologies are also well-suited for scaling:

- React applications can be optimized for performance at scale.
- Serverless platforms (Vercel, Cloudflare) offer paid tiers for increased limits and features.
- Supabase offers paid tiers for larger databases and more resources.
- GraphQL APIs can be scaled effectively.

This stack provides a solid foundation for AestheticPalettes, balancing the immediate need for a zero-cost solution with the potential for future growth.
