# UI/UX Design Guide: AestheticPalettes

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the UI/UX design guidelines for the AestheticPalettes application, as per task T027. The goal is to create a user-friendly, professional-looking, and highly accessible interface that mirrors the functionality of Coolors.co while adhering to best practices and the project's zero-cost constraint.

## 2. Core Design Principles

These principles, derived from NFRs and design best practices, will guide all UI/UX decisions:

- **User-Centricity:** Design decisions will prioritize the needs and goals of the target users (designers, developers, artists, hobbyists).
- **Simplicity & Clarity:** The interface should be intuitive and easy to understand, avoiding unnecessary complexity (NFR2.3).
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent design patterns, terminology, and interactions throughout the application.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Clearly guide the user's attention to important elements and actions.
- **Feedback:** Provide clear and timely feedback for user actions (e.g., loading states, success/error messages).
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AAA):** The application must be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users, including those with disabilities (NFR2.1).
- **Mobile-First & Responsive Design:** Design for mobile devices first, then adapt for tablet and desktop screen sizes to ensure a seamless experience across all platforms (NFR2.2, NFR2.5).
- **Professional Aesthetics:** The UI should be modern, clean, and visually appealing, instilling trust and credibility (NFR2.4).
- **Efficiency:** Enable users to accomplish tasks quickly and with minimal effort.

## 3. Target Audience

- Web designers and developers.
- Graphic designers and illustrators.
- Artists and digital creators.
- Hobbyists and students interested in color theory.
- Marketing and branding professionals.

## 4. Accessibility (A11Y) Strategy (NFR2.1)

Accessibility is a paramount concern. The application will strive for **WCAG 2.1 Level AAA compliance**.

- **Semantic HTML:** Use HTML5 elements according to their intended purpose.
- **ARIA Attributes:** Employ ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes where necessary to enhance accessibility for dynamic content and custom controls.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard alone, with a logical tab order and visible focus indicators.
- **Color Contrast:** All text and meaningful visual elements must meet or exceed WCAG AAA contrast ratios (7:1 for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text).
- **Alternative Text:** Provide descriptive alt text for all meaningful images.
- **Resizable Text:** Users should be able to resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.
- **Forms:** Clearly label all form inputs and provide clear error messages and instructions.
- **Assistive Technology Compatibility:** Test with common screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) and other assistive technologies.
- **Motion & Animation:** Avoid unnecessary animations. Provide mechanisms to pause, stop, or hide motion if it's essential.

## 5. UI Design Elements (Style Guide - To Be Developed in Detail)

This section will be expanded as part of T040 (Develop Style Guide). Initial thoughts:

### 5.1. Color Palette (Application UI, not user-generated palettes)

- **Primary Colors:** To be defined. Likely a neutral base with one or two accent colors that are accessible.
- **Secondary Colors:** To be defined.
- **Greyscale:** A range of greys for text, backgrounds, and UI elements.
- **Feedback Colors:** Standard colors for success (green), error (red), warning (yellow/orange), info (blue).
  - All UI colors must meet accessibility contrast requirements.

### 5.2. Typography

- **Font Family:** Select a clean, readable, and open-source sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Lato, Open Sans).
- **Font Sizes & Hierarchy:** Establish a clear typographic scale for headings, body text, labels, etc.
- **Line Height & Spacing:** Ensure comfortable readability.

### 5.3. Iconography

- Use a consistent set of clear, recognizable icons (e.g., from a library like Feather Icons, Material Icons, or custom SVGs).
- Ensure icons have appropriate text alternatives or ARIA labels if they convey meaning.

### 5.4. Spacing & Layout

- Employ a consistent spacing system (e.g., 4px or 8px grid) for margins, paddings, and layout structure.
- Utilize responsive grid systems (e.g., CSS Grid, Flexbox) for layout.

### 5.5. Component Design

- **Buttons:** Clear visual states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled). Accessible focus indicators.
- **Input Fields:** Clearly defined borders, labels, placeholder text, and validation states.
- **Modals & Dialogs:** Proper focus management, keyboard operability (Esc to close).
- **Navigation:** Intuitive and consistent navigation patterns (e.g., header navigation, sidebars for complex sections).
- **Cards:** For displaying palettes, collections, etc.

## 6. Wireframes and Mockups (To Be Developed - T038, T039)

Wireframes and mockups will be developed using a free-tier design tool (e.g., Figma free tier, Penpot).

- **Key Screens to Design:**
  - Homepage / Palette Generator (Core Coolors.co functionality)
  - Color Picker / Editor
  - Palette View/Details Page
  - Explore/Trending Palettes Page
  - User Profile Page
  - Saved Palettes / Collections Page
  - Login/Registration Pages
  - Settings Page
  - Specific tool pages (e.g., contrast checker, gradient generator)

## 7. User Experience Flow

- **Palette Generation:** Simple, intuitive controls for generating, locking, adjusting, and reordering colors.
- **Saving & Managing Palettes:** Clear actions for saving, naming, tagging, and organizing palettes into collections.
- **Exploration & Discovery:** Easy ways to browse public palettes, search, filter by tags, and discover trending content.
- **User Onboarding (Optional):** Consider a brief tour or contextual hints for new users.

## 8. Responsive Design Strategy (NFR2.2, NFR2.5)

- **Mobile-First Approach:** Design for the smallest viewport first, then progressively enhance for larger screens.
- **Breakpoints:** Define standard breakpoints (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop, large desktop).
- **Fluid Layouts:** Use relative units (percentages, em, rem) and flexible containers.
- **Touch-Friendly:** Ensure interactive elements are large enough for touch targets on mobile devices.
- **Performance:** Optimize images and assets for different screen sizes.

## 9. Tools

- **Design Tool:** Figma (free tier) or Penpot (open source).
- **Accessibility Testing:** Axe DevTools (browser extension), WAVE (browser extension), Lighthouse, screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver).

## 10. Iteration and Feedback

The UI/UX design will be an iterative process. Feedback will be gathered (e.g., through informal user testing if possible, or self-critique based on heuristics) and used to refine the design throughout the development lifecycle.

This guide will be a living document, updated as the design evolves and specific components are detailed.
