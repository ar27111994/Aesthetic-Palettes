# Accessibility Plan

This document outlines the accessibility plan for the AestheticPalettes project, ensuring the platform is usable by people with the widest possible range of abilities, with a target of WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance.

## Overview

_(Detailed accessibility plan to be populated from Sections 5.3 - Accessibility Framework and 6.2 - Accessibility Implementation of the main `documentation.md`)_

The accessibility plan is integral to the project and encompasses:

- **Core Principles:** Adherence to POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust).
- **Standards Compliance:** Targeting WCAG 2.1 Level AAA for all components and content.
- **Design Considerations:** Incorporating accessibility from the initial design phase (cross-reference `user-experience-design.md`).
- **Development Practices:** Using semantic HTML, ARIA attributes where necessary, ensuring keyboard navigability, and providing sufficient color contrast.
- **Testing:** Regular accessibility audits using automated tools and manual testing, including assistive technology user testing (cross-reference `testing-strategy.md`).
- **Documentation:** Documenting accessibility features and considerations.
