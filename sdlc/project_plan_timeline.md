# Project Plan & Timeline for AestheticPalettes

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the project plan and timeline for the development of AestheticPalettes, a zero-cost, feature-complete alternative to Coolors.co. The project follows a Waterfall development methodology.

## 2. Project Goals

- Create a zero-cost infrastructure implementation of a color palette generation platform.
- Match or exceed all features available in Coolors.co.
- Implement at least 10 enhanced features including AI integrations.
- Achieve strict WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance throughout the platform.
- Optimize for search engines to drive organic traffic.
- Establish a sustainable user acquisition and retention strategy.
- Complete the project using the Waterfall development methodology.

## 3. Development Methodology: Waterfall Model

The project will adhere to a structured Waterfall model, ensuring a sequential progression through distinct phases. This approach is chosen for its clarity in defining stages, deliverables, and milestones, which is suitable for a project with well-defined initial requirements.

### Waterfall Phases:

1.  **Requirements Analysis (Completed)**

    - Detailed analysis of Coolors.co features.
    - Documentation of all functional (FR), non-functional (NFR), and enhanced feature requirements.
    - Risk assessment and initial project planning.
    - Document Enhanced Features Requirements (T020)

2.  **System Design (In Progress - Target for this step)**

    - Selection of technology stack (Frontend, Backend, Database, Auth).
    - Design of overall system architecture (JAMstack, Serverless, Static Frontend).
    - Database schema design (e.g., Firebase/Firestore).
    - API design (e.g., GraphQL schema, endpoints).
    - User authentication flow design (e.g., Auth0).
    - UI/UX wireframing and prototyping.
    - Accessibility strategy planning (WCAG 2.1 AAA).
    - SEO strategy implementation planning.
    - Zero-cost infrastructure planning.
    - Security architecture design.

3.  **Implementation**

    - Setup of development environment and version control (Git/GitHub).
    - Frontend development (React, TypeScript, Vite, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI).
    - Integration of color processing libraries (chroma.js, colord).
    - Backend development (Serverless functions, e.g., Cloudflare Workers or Vercel Functions).
    - Database implementation (e.g., Supabase/Firestore setup and integration).
    - Authentication system implementation.
    - Development of core palette generation features.
    - Implementation of color manipulation tools.
    - Development of user account and palette management features.
    - Implementation of export functionalities.
    - Development of community and exploration features.
    - UI development based on designs and prototypes.
    - Integration of all components.

4.  **Testing**

    - Unit testing for individual components and functions.
    - Integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between modules.
    - System testing to verify overall application functionality against requirements.
    - User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with a focus group or beta testers.
    - Performance testing to ensure NFRs for speed and scalability are met.
    - Accessibility testing against WCAG 2.1 AAA standards.
    - Security testing (vulnerability scans, penetration testing if feasible within zero-cost).
    - Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility testing.

5.  **Deployment**

    - Preparation of production environment (Vercel/Netlify, Supabase, Cloudflare).
    - Configuration of CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.
    - Final data migration if necessary.
    - Launch of the application.
    - Post-launch monitoring and smoke testing.

6.  **Maintenance**
    - Ongoing monitoring of application performance, uptime, and user feedback.
    - Bug fixing and issue resolution.
    - Regular updates to dependencies and security patches.
    - Periodic review of zero-cost service limits and optimization.
    - Implementation of minor enhancements and feature updates based on user feedback and evolving needs.

## Resource Allocation

| Role     | Phase 2 | Phase 3 |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Frontend | 1 FTE   | 2 FTE   |
| Backend  | 1 FTE   | 1 FTE   |
| QA       | -       | 1 FTE   |

## 5. Resource Allocation

- **Project Manager/Lead Developer:** Ahmed Rehan (Responsible for overseeing all phases, technical decisions, and core development contributions).
- **Potential Future Contributors:** (To be identified for specific tasks if needed, focusing on open-source community or volunteer contributions if project scales beyond single-person capacity within zero-cost constraints).

## 6. Assumptions

- All required features from Coolors.co are clearly understood.
- Free-tier services will remain available and sufficient for the project's scale during development and initial launch.
- Access to necessary open-source libraries and tools is unhindered.
- The project scope remains stable post the Requirements Analysis phase.

## 7. Dependencies
