# Monetization Strategy

This document outlines the monetization strategy for the AestheticPalettes project, focusing on sustainable approaches that align with the zero-cost infrastructure goal.

## Overview

_(Detailed monetization strategy to be populated from Section 12 of the main `documentation.md`)_

Given the project's commitment to a zero-cost infrastructure and providing a free core tool, monetization will focus on non-intrusive and value-added services. Potential avenues include:

- **Affiliate Marketing:** Partnerships with relevant design tool providers, stock photo sites, or educational platforms.
- **Donations:** A clear and unobtrusive way for satisfied users to support the project (e.g., via Patreon, Buy Me a Coffee).
- **Premium Features (Future Consideration):** While the core functionality will remain free, advanced, non-essential features could be offered under a freemium model if the user base grows significantly and demand is evident. This would require careful consideration to maintain the zero-cost ethos for core services.
- **Contextual, Ethical Advertising:** If implemented, ads would be minimal, relevant to designers, and clearly distinguished from content, adhering to ethical advertising practices.

## Phased Approach

_(Details on how monetization strategies might be rolled out over time, based on Section 12 of `documentation.md`)_

- **Phase 1 (Launch):** Focus on user acquisition and community building. Implement donation options.
- **Phase 2 (Growth):** Explore affiliate marketing opportunities.
- **Phase 3 (Maturity):** Evaluate the potential for premium features or ethical advertising based on user feedback and platform scale.
