# Deployment Plan

This document outlines the deployment plan for the AestheticPalettes project, ensuring a smooth and efficient rollout of the application.

## Overview

_(Detailed deployment plan to be populated from Section 10 of the main `documentation.md`)_

The deployment strategy will focus on leveraging zero-cost infrastructure solutions like Vercel/Netlify for hosting and Cloudflare Workers for edge logic, as specified in the technical requirements.

Key aspects of the deployment plan include:

- **Environment Setup:** Configuration of development, staging, and production environments.
- **Build Process:** Automated build and bundling of the application.
- **Deployment Strategy:** (e.g., Blue/Green, Canary releases, though likely simpler for initial zero-cost setup).
- **Rollback Plan:** Procedures for reverting to a previous stable version if issues arise.
- **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Setting up tools to monitor application health and performance.
