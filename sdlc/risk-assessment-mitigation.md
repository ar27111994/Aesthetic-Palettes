# Risk Assessment and Mitigation for AestheticPalettes

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the potential risks associated with the AestheticPalettes project and the strategies to mitigate them. Identifying and addressing risks proactively is crucial for project success, especially given the constraints of zero-cost infrastructure and an ambitious feature set. This aligns with task T022 of the project roadmap.

## 2. Risk Categories

Risks can be categorized into:

- **Technical Risks:** Related to technology choices, implementation complexity, performance, security, and scalability.
- **Project Management Risks:** Related to scope, schedule, resources, and communication.
- **External Risks:** Related to dependencies on third-party services (free tiers), open-source libraries, and changes in the external environment.

## 3. Risk Register and Mitigation Strategies

The following table details identified risks, their likelihood, potential impact, and mitigation strategies:

Build in buffer time in the schedule. Prioritize core features. Leverage existing libraries where possible.                                                                                                         |
| R003    | Free-tier limitations become restrictive               | External/Technical    | Medium     | High   | Design for efficiency from the outset. Optimize resource usage (database queries, function executions, bandwidth). Continuously monitor usage against limits. Have contingency plans for alternative free services or optimizing existing ones.                      |
| R004    | Technical challenges with new technologies/APIs        | Technical             | Medium     | Medium | Allocate time for research and learning. Develop Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) for risky components early. Choose mature and well-documented technologies.                                                                                                                |

Leverage scalable BaaS features. Monitor performance and scale resources as needed (within free tier limits or plan for upgrade path).                                                 |

## 4. Risk Monitoring and Review

- Risks will be reviewed periodically, especially at the end of each major project phase.
- The risk register will be updated as new risks are identified or existing ones change.
- Mitigation strategies will be assessed for their effectiveness.

## 5. Conclusion

A proactive approach to risk management is essential for AestheticPalettes. By identifying, analyzing, and planning mitigation for potential risks, the project aims to navigate challenges effectively and achieve its objectives within the defined constraints.
