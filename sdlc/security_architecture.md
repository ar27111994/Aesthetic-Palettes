# Security Architecture for AestheticPalettes

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the security architecture for the AestheticPalettes application, as per task T032 and NFR3 (Security Requirements). The goal is to establish a robust security posture, protecting user data, ensuring application integrity, and preventing common web vulnerabilities. This plan aligns with the project's zero-cost infrastructure constraint by leveraging built-in security features of chosen services and implementing best practices in the application code.

## 2. Guiding Principles

- **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security controls.
- **Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users and services.
- **Secure by Design:** Integrate security considerations throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Data Minimization:** Collect and store only essential user data.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies and platforms up-to-date to patch vulnerabilities.
- **Compliance with Project Rule 6:** App should be secure, private, confidential, and compliant with all applicable laws and regulations.

## 3. Key Security Measures & Implementation

### 3.1. Data Transmission Security (NFR3.1)

- **Requirement:** Encrypt all data in transit.
- **Implementation:**
  - **HTTPS Everywhere:** The entire application will be served over HTTPS.
  - **Service Providers:** Vercel/Netlify (for frontend and serverless functions) and Firebase provide free, automatically renewing SSL/TLS certificates for custom domains.
  - **Configuration:** Ensure HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers are enabled to enforce HTTPS connections.
    - `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` (Consider adding to `preload` list after stability).

### 3.2. Authentication & Authorization (NFR3.2, FR3.x)

- **Requirement:** Secure user authentication and manage access controls.
- \*\*Implementation (referencing `authentication_flow.md` - T027):
  - **Chosen Service:** Firebase Authentication (or Auth0 as an alternative).
  - **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce minimum password length and complexity (if using email/password).
  - **Secure Password Storage:** Handled by Firebase Auth/Auth0 (uses hashing and salting, e.g., scrypt for Firebase).
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Encourage or require MFA if supported by the free tier and deemed necessary for sensitive actions (Firebase Auth supports TOTP).
  - **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect:** Use for social logins (Google, GitHub, etc.) to delegate authentication to trusted providers.
  - **Session Management:** Use secure, short-lived tokens (JWTs) provided by the authentication service. Store tokens securely on the client (e.g., HttpOnly cookies if server-side sessions are managed, or secure browser storage for SPAs, being mindful of XSS).
  - **Authorization:** Implement role-based or permission-based access control on API endpoints and Firestore data using security rules.

### 3.3. Input Validation & Sanitization (NFR3.3)

- **Requirement:** Prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi - though NoSQL is used, NoSQL injection is possible).
- **Implementation:**
  - **Client-Side Validation:** For improved UX, but not as a sole security measure.
  - **Server-Side Validation:** Rigorously validate all user inputs (lengths, types, formats) in serverless functions before processing or storing.
    - Use libraries like Zod or Joi for schema validation.
  - **Output Encoding:** Encode data appropriately when rendering it in the UI to prevent XSS. Svelte automatically escapes dynamic content by default. Be cautious with `{@html ...}`.
  - **Parameterized Queries/Operations:** For Firestore, use the SDK methods which inherently prevent NoSQL injection vulnerabilities common with string concatenation.

### 3.4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention (NFR3.3)

- **Requirement:** Protect against XSS attacks.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Output Encoding:** As mentioned above, ensure Svelte's default encoding is utilized. Sanitize any user-supplied HTML if `{@html ...}` is absolutely necessary (e.g., using DOMPurify).
  - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict sources of executable scripts, styles, images, etc.
    - Example (restrictive, needs tailoring):
      `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com https://www.gstatic.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; img-src 'self' data: https://*.googleusercontent.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; connect-src 'self' https://*.firebaseio.com wss://*.firebaseio.com https://securetoken.googleapis.com https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com; frame-ancestors 'none';`
    - CSP can be set via meta tags or HTTP headers (preferred, configurable in Vercel/Netlify `_headers` or `vercel.json`/`netlify.toml`).
  - **HttpOnly & Secure Cookies:** If using cookies for session tokens, set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.

### 3.5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention (NFR3.4)

- **Requirement:** Protect against CSRF attacks for state-changing operations.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Stateless APIs (JWTs):** If using JWTs in Authorization headers for API calls, CSRF is less of a concern for the API itself as browsers don't automatically send these headers.
  - **For Traditional Form Submissions / State-Changing GET Requests (if any):**
    - Use CSRF tokens (e.g., Double Submit Cookie pattern, Synchronizer Token Pattern).
    - Check `Origin` or `Referer` headers (can be unreliable but adds a layer).
  - **SvelteKit Form Actions:** SvelteKit's form actions have built-in CSRF protection when progressively enhanced.

### 3.6. Database Security (NFR3.5)

- **Requirement:** Secure data at rest and control access.
- \*\*Implementation (Firebase Firestore):
  - **Firestore Security Rules:** Implement robust security rules to control read/write access to data based on user authentication and roles. This is the primary defense for Firestore.
    - Default deny: Start with rules that deny all access, then explicitly allow specific operations.
    - Validate data structure and content within security rules.
  - **Data Encryption at Rest:** Firestore encrypts data at rest by default.
  - **Least Privilege for Admin SDK:** Serverless functions using the Firebase Admin SDK should operate with the least privilege necessary. Avoid using a single super-admin service account for all operations if finer-grained control is needed (though for simpler apps, this is common).

### 3.7. API Security (NFR3.6)

- **Requirement:** Secure API endpoints.
- \*\*Implementation (GraphQL API via Serverless Functions):
  - **Authentication & Authorization:** All mutations and sensitive queries must require authentication. Authorization logic applied within resolvers.
  - **Input Validation:** Validate all arguments to queries and mutations.
  - **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
    - Can be done at the function level (e.g., using a timestamp and count in Firestore per user/IP) or via API Gateway features if one were used (Vercel/Netlify might offer basic protections).
    - Focus on critical or expensive operations first.
  - **Query Depth/Complexity Limiting:** For GraphQL, implement limits on query depth and complexity to prevent abusive queries.
  - **Error Handling:** Return generic error messages; avoid exposing sensitive system information.

### 3.8. Dependency Management (NFR3.7)

- **Requirement:** Mitigate risks from third-party libraries.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Use tools like `npm audit` or GitHub Dependabot to identify and update vulnerable dependencies.
  - **Minimize Dependencies:** Only use necessary libraries from trusted sources.
  - **Review Code:** Be cautious when adding new dependencies.

### 3.9. Security Headers

- **Requirement:** Utilize HTTP security headers to instruct browsers on security policies.
- \*\*Implementation (via Vercel/Netlify configuration):
  - **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):** As detailed above.
  - **HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):** As detailed above.
  - **X-Content-Type-Options:** `nosniff` (Prevents MIME-sniffing).
  - **X-Frame-Options:** `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` (Protects against clickjacking).
  - **Referrer-Policy:** `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` or `no-referrer` (Controls referrer information sent).
  - **Permissions-Policy (Feature-Policy):** `Permissions-Policy: microphone=(), camera=(), geolocation=()` (Restrict access to sensitive browser features if not used).

### 3.10. Logging & Monitoring (Basic)

- **Requirement:** Log security-relevant events for auditing and incident response.
- \*\*Implementation (within zero-cost limits):
  - **Serverless Function Logs:** Vercel/Netlify provide logs for function invocations, which can include errors or custom log statements.
  - **Firebase Auth Logs:** Firebase console shows authentication events.
  - **Application-Level Logging:** Log critical security events (e.g., failed logins, permission denials) to function logs. Be careful not to log sensitive data.
  - **Sentry.io (Free Tier):** For client-side and server-side error tracking, which can reveal security issues.

### 3.11. Regular Security Audits & Testing (Manual)

- **Requirement:** Proactively identify vulnerabilities.
- **Implementation:**
  - Perform manual security testing based on OWASP Top 10 and OWASP ASVS.
  - Conduct code reviews with a security focus.
  - Use free security scanning tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP basic scan, browser developer tools for security checks) periodically.

## 4. Incident Response Plan (Conceptual)

- **Identify:** Detect security incidents through monitoring, user reports.
- **Contain:** Isolate affected systems/data if possible.
- **Eradicate:** Remove the cause of the incident (e.g., patch vulnerability, block attacker).
- **Recover:** Restore systems and data.
- **Lessons Learned:** Analyze the incident and improve security measures.
  _Note: A full-fledged IR plan is complex; this is a high-level conceptual outline for a zero-cost project._

By implementing these security measures, AestheticPalettes aims to provide a secure environment for its users and protect its data and services, adhering to NFR3 and project rule 6.
